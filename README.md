Image Caption Generator
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (VGG16) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to generate captions for images. The generated captions are then converted to audio output using a text-to-speech module.

Overview
The Image Caption Generator project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze an image and generate a descriptive caption. The model architecture includes:

VGG16: A pre-trained convolutional neural network for image feature extraction.
LSTM: A type of recurrent neural network used for generating sequences, in this case, text captions.
Text-to-Speech: Converts the generated text captions to audio output.
Features
Image upload via a web interface.
Automatic generation of image captions.
Conversion of text captions to audio.
User-friendly Streamlit app for easy interaction.
Usage
Run the Streamlit app:

Open your browser and navigate to the local Streamlit app URL (usually http://localhost:8501).
Use the file uploader to upload an image for caption generation.
After uploading the image, the app will display the generated caption and provide an audio playback option.
Try the app online: You can try the app online by visiting this link.
